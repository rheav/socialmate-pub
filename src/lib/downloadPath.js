// The single owner of every download path this extension produces.
//
// Before this module each call site invented its own folder: "socialmate-comments/",
// "socialmate-fotos/", "socialmate-runs/", "socialMate-thumbs/" (yes, a different
// capital M) — and most downloads had no folder at all, so photos, reels, stories
// and muxed videos landed loose in ~/Downloads. Four spellings for four folders and
// a dozen files spilled into the Downloads root: "fica bagunçado".
//
// The first fix over-corrected into root → platform → kind: 22 directories, built
// from a platform map plus a per-platform kind map (which is how Facebook ended up
// with "fotos" while everyone else got "imagens"). Both maps were redundant with
// the file name, because every name this extension produces ALREADY says where the
// file came from and what it is:
//
//   fb-astravale-1234.jpg   ig-ivy-DaBFBcgxZIi.mp4   tt-creator001-765….mp4
//   tt-creator001-765…-thumb.jpg   ig-tag_cardreading-2026-08-16.xlsx
//
// So "social-mate/tiktok/videos/tt-…-765….mp4" said "tiktok" twice and "video"
// twice. Only ONE thing still earns a folder: keeping bulk junk away from the file
// you went there for. A cover dump is 50-200 thumbnails and JSON/XLSX are data, not
// media. That is three buckets, and nothing else:
//
//   social-mate/
//     videos/    every .mp4, whatever platform it came from
//     imagens/   photos AND covers (a cover is already named "…-thumb.jpg")
//     dados/     comment JSON, spreadsheets, transcripts, album ZIPs
//
// Folder names are pt-BR because the user browses them in Finder and the whole UI
// is pt-BR. The KEYS stay the internal English media kinds, so no call site has to
// learn a new vocabulary — they pass the same `kind` they always did.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// and cannot import. Re-exported here so every existing caller is unchanged.

// bucketing are settings (Opções → Downloads), because "sem folders e mais
// folders" is a legitimate way to want your files — a flat folder sorts by name,
// and every name this extension produces starts with the creator's handle.
//
// CHROME'S LIMIT, which the setting cannot lift: chrome.downloads.download only
// accepts a path RELATIVE to the browser's own download directory. An absolute
// path ("/Users/…", "D:\\") is rejected outright, and so is any "..". So an empty
// folder setting means "straight into the browser's download directory", and
// pointing that somewhere else is a browser setting (chrome://settings/downloads),
// not something an extension can do.
