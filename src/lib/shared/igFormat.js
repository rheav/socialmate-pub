// src/lib/igMedia.js re-exports all of it, so the panel's IG Sort tool and the
// in-page overlay run one implementation. They used to run two: bridge.js carried
// erOf / fmtDateOvl / dateFromPkOvl / fmtErOvl / sanit / igExt / igName as hand
// copies, including a SECOND literal of the snowflake epoch below — a number that
// would have to be changed in both places on the same day, and never would be.

// ER weights — IG Sorter's defaults (comments & reposts each count 4×, likes 1×).
// Tweak to reweight; the overlay and the panel both read these.
//
// Passive-only data: counts come from JSON Instagram parses itself (we make no API
// calls of our own). Reels-tab payloads carry views; posts-grid payloads often
// don't. Missing reposts count as 0; missing views make ER null so ER-sorted lists
// and labels degrade gracefully (null sorts last, shows "—").

// setting (0.99.0) a flat folder is a supported layout, and in a flat folder the
