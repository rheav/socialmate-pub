// ============================================================================
// The ONE shared recipe for a tool's control row in the side panel.
//
// WHY NOT `sm:` / `md:`: Tailwind's default breakpoints are min-width MEDIA
// queries starting at 640px. This panel is an extension page whose window IS the
// side panel — it is ALWAYS narrower than 640px, so those variants could never
// fire. Instead ToolBar declares a named CONTAINER (`@container/toolbar`) and
// the controls inside use `@max-[…]/toolbar:` variants, which react to the
// ROW's own width. That is also more accurate than a media query would be: a
// row's usable width is the panel minus the page's px-4 gutters (minus card
// padding again when the row is nested inside a card), and a container query
// measures exactly that, automatically.
//
// WHY the container is scoped to the row (and to the Shell header) rather than
// to the whole panel: `container-type: inline-size` implies `contain: layout`,
// which makes the element a containing block for `position: fixed` descendants.
// The transcript modals (`fixed inset-0`) live inside the tool panels, so a
// panel-wide container would silently re-anchor them. Toolbars never contain
// overlays, so scoping the container to them is safe.
// ============================================================================

// TWO thresholds, both measured in the real panel font (Outfit,
// html{font-size:15px} — so 1rem is 15px and every Tailwind spacing value is
// 15/16 of its nominal px). Numbers are ROW widths, i.e. panel width minus the
// page's 2×15px gutters (and minus card padding for a nested row).
//
//   • default 308px — labels switch ON at a 339px panel (339 − 30 = 309 > 308).
//     That is where the ordinary 3–4 control rows stop fitting their pt-BR
//     labels. Measured natural (all-labels) widths: WarmTool run-controls 228,
//     IgSort 248, FbComments post picker 266, TtSort 281, FbReels 284. Every one
//     clears 308 with room left for the row's flexible member.
//
//   • dense 390px — labels switch ON at a 422px panel. For a row that is three
//     labelled buttons PLUS a select. PinBoardTool's
//     [Coletar][Limpar][Tudo (N)][Ordem da pasta] measures 447px fully expanded;
//     at the default threshold its labels would switch on at a 339px panel and
//     squeeze the sorter down to 33px — labels technically visible, control
//     useless. 390 is that 447 minus the ~57px the select can give up before it
//     stops reading as a word (it still gets ≥115px anywhere above 390).
//
// A row opts into the second tier with <ToolBar dense>. It works by naming the
// container differently; the controls emit BOTH variants and only the one whose
// named container is actually an ancestor can ever match, so nothing else has
// to know which tier it is in.
export const TOOLBAR_COMPACT_MAX = 308;
export const TOOLBAR_DENSE_COMPACT_MAX = 390;

// Tailwind scans SOURCE TEXT, so these must be literal strings — a template
// literal interpolating the constants above would emit no CSS at all.
const HIDE_WHEN_NARROW = "@max-[308px]/toolbar:hidden @max-[390px]/toolbardense:hidden";
const SHOW_WHEN_NARROW = "@min-[308.05px]/toolbar:hidden @min-[390.05px]/toolbardense:hidden";
const TIGHTEN_WHEN_NARROW = "@max-[308px]/toolbar:px-2 @max-[390px]/toolbardense:px-2";

// ============================================================================
// TOOLTIPS FOR THE ICON-ONLY STATE  (styles: src/index.css, `.sw-tip`)
// The same mechanism drives components/ui/Segmented.jsx — one implementation,
// two hosts. Anything exported from here that another host needs lives in
// TipCarrier below.
//
// WHY THE TOOLTIP IS CSS AND NOT A REACT COMPONENT
// Whether a control still shows its text label is decided ENTIRELY by the
// container query above (`HIDE_WHEN_NARROW`). React never sees that — it is a
// CSS media-ish condition on the row's own width. Driving a JS tooltip off a
// ResizeObserver would create a SECOND source of truth for the one fact that
// matters ("is the label visible right now?"), and the two can disagree: while
// the panel is being dragged, on the first paint before the observer fires, or
// whenever a future change moves one threshold and not the other.
//
// So the tooltip rides on a carrier <span> rendered with `SHOW_WHEN_NARROW` —
// the EXACT complement of the query that hides the label, already defined above
// and already used by ToolSelect. In every width where the label is visible the
// carrier is `display:none`, and a `display:none` element generates no `::after`
// box, so there is nothing to show. Label visible ⇔ no tooltip, by construction,
// with zero JS and no second copy of the thresholds.
//
// WHY THE NATIVE `title` IS GONE
// It was the previous tooltip, and it fired at EVERY width — including the wide
// one where the label is sitting right there next to the icon. That is noise,
// and `title` can't be conditioned on a container query. `aria-label` stays on
// every control, so the accessible name is unchanged.
// ============================================================================

// The carrier is a SIBLING of its control, never a child, for two reasons:
//   • It is `position: absolute`, and abspos children are skipped by flex/grid
//     layout, so it adds no item and no `gap` to the row. As a child it would
//     have done the same, but…
//   • …button.jsx sets `active:scale-[0.985]`, and a non-`none` `scale` turns
//     the button into a containing block. A carrier INSIDE the button would
//     therefore re-anchor from the row to the button for the duration of every
//     click — the bubble would visibly jump and re-wrap mid-press. Outside, its
//     containing block is always the row (ToolBar marks it `relative`).
// `when` is the container-query gate; omitted means "always" — either a control
// that is icon-only at every width (ToolIconButton), or a host that already
// knows in JS whether it is collapsed and so renders the carrier conditionally
// (Segmented). Exported for that second case: the markup contract
// (aria-hidden + data-sw-tip + .sw-tip) must exist in exactly one place.
//
// It is `aria-hidden` and empty — the text is CSS `content: attr(data-sw-tip)`,
// so screen readers never see it and nothing focusable was hidden. The
// accessible name stays the control's own `aria-label`.
export function TipCarrier({ text, when }) {
  if (!text) return null;
  return <span aria-hidden="true" data-sw-tip={text} className={cn("sw-tip", when)} />;
}

// A tool's control row: establishes the container and lays the controls out on
// one non-wrapping line that is allowed to shrink (`min-w-0`).
//
// `className` is merged onto the inner row, so a caller can swap the layout
// wholesale (e.g. `grid grid-cols-2 …` — twMerge drops the default `flex`)
// while still getting the container.
//
// `relative z-20` on the OUTER box (the one callers cannot restyle) is what
// makes the tooltips safe: it is the carriers' containing block, so a bubble
// clamped to `max-width: 100%` is clamped to the ROW's width and can never
// reach the panel edge at any panel size — a geometric guarantee rather than a
// pixel budget that a future 5-control row would silently break. `z-20` lifts
// the row above whatever follows it (the modals in the tool panels are z-50 and
// still win). Note the container already established a stacking context:
// `container-type` implies `contain: layout`.
//
// `sw-toolbar-shell` exists so index.css can raise THIS row above the next one
// while it is being pointed at: two stacked ToolBars both sit at z-20, and on a
// tie the later one wins, which would let the row below paint over the bubble.

// `options`: [{ value, label, short? }]; `short` defaults to `label`.
