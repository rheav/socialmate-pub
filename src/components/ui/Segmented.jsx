// Segmented control with a single thumb that FLOWS between options — the thumb's
// left/width transition (liquid slide) instead of snapping.
//
// The thumb is the `sky` wash the migrated design language uses for a chosen tab
// (a 15% bath of the accent with a 30% ring), not the solid brand gradient it
// used to be: at panel width a tab is nearly as wide as the panel, and a solid
// accent block that size reads as a filled button rather than as a selection.
// The label stays in full `fg` — sky as TEXT does not clear AA over its own wash
// in the light theme — and it is the ICON that takes the accent.
//
// Narrow panels: TikTok has FIVE tools, and pt-BR labels ("Comentários",
// "Playlists") are long. Rather than clip the last tab, the control measures
// whether the labels fit and degrades to ICONS ONLY when they don't.
//
// In that icon-only state each button gets the shared CSS bubble (TipCarrier +
// `.sw-tips` on the track — the one implementation, see index.css); when the
// labels are showing it gets nothing, because a tooltip repeating a visible
// label is noise. That is also why the native `title` is gone: it could not be
// conditioned on the collapsed state and fired at every width. `aria-label` is
// on every button at every width, so the announced name never changed.
//
// Segmented is the one host that can gate the carrier in JS honestly: unlike
// ToolBar — where the collapse is a container query React cannot see — `compact`
// IS the collapsed state, measured right here. No second source of truth.
